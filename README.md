Howdy!

I'm in between colleges at the moment, but I guess I'm still a physics undergrad.

My main interests are in condensed matter physics, electronics (mostly for music), DSP, and game development. For a while I did most of my coding in
Python, but I got sick of it being slow—and I didn't feel like learning Cython or numbaso I'm learning Julia right now.
