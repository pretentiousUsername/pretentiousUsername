Howdy!

I'm a first-year undergraduate physics student at Temple University,
with a rather special interest in condensed matter physics—mostly
with interacting many-body theory and nanosystems. This github is
strictly for *professional* stuff; if it's code for a paper, or if it
looks good on a CV, it'll be on here.
